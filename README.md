# Pac-Man-AI
This project is taken from Berkeley's CS188 class. You can find more information about it [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

```
Search
	Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. 
	Used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
	
	Files you'll edit (There are lots of comments to help guide you):
	search.py	Where all of your search algorithms will reside.
	searchAgents.py	Where all of your search-based agents will reside.
	
	You can run bfs using these commands:
	python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent
	python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent
	python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent
	
	If you want to run bfs add the "-a fn=bfs", e.g. python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs

	Check out Questions 1 and 2. They give further advice and clear things up a bit.
